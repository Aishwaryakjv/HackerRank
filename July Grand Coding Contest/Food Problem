Is it possible that he will be able to serve food for all his pets in the store if each of his dogs and each of his cats should receive one pack of suitable food for it.

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer t — the number of test cases in the input.

Then t lines are given, each containing a description of one test case. Each description consists of five integers a,b,c,x and y.

Constraints

1≤ t ≤10^4 0≤ a,b,c,x,y ≤10^8

Output Format

For each test case in a separate line, output:

YES, if suitable food can be bought for each of x dogs and for each of y cats; NO else.

All letters in the output should be in uppercase.
