Mythili got a "mysterious pocket".

If you put a few biscuits in the ''mysterious pocket'' and hit it, the number of biscuits you put in will double.

(Note: She can put any number of biscuits in the pocket, not necessarily all.) (Don't go over the number because Mythili won't be able to eat it all.)
