In one step, you can walk 'a' centimeters, given b centimeteres, how many steps are needed?

Input Format

each line contains two integers, a, b

a denotes the number of centimetres you can walk in 1 step b denotes total number of steps

Constraints

1 <= a,b <= 10^9

Output Format

Output a single integer, which denotes the total number of steps.

Sample Input 0

1 1
Sample Output 0

int main() {
    float a,b;
    cin>>a;
    cin>>b;
    float c=b/a;
    int d=ceil(c);
    cout<<d;
    //cout << ceil(15.08);
    //cout << ceil(15);
    return 0;
}


note:
generally if u have int a,int b;
if a=2;b=3;
float c=b/a gives 1 not 1.5 even though c is float 
where as if u were given float a,b
then b/a is 1.5

eg code:
int a=2,b=3; float c=b/a; print c;
output: 1.0

float a=2,b=3; float c=b/a; print c;
output: 1.5


The ceil() function returns double value. //in java
The ceil() function returns int value.//cpp
